# ContentMachineComplete 🚀

Welcome to the future, where you're just a click away from scheduling months of content across all platforms! Say goodbye to those tedious hours spent planning and say hello to more time doing what you do best - creating amazing content.

## Overview 📖

Our AI Content Scheduler is a snazzy web app with a Python backend that will do the heavy lifting for you. It's not just your ordinary scheduler - it's like your personal content concierge with a double major in Computer Science and Creativity.

You feed it with raw content and in return, it churns out a refined content calendar, making it feel like there are more hours in your day. A modern miracle of artificial intelligence, right at your fingertips. Pythonically speaking, of course.

## Features 🎯

- **Content Analysis**: Our AI isn't just smart, it's also a bit of a literature buff. It'll chew through your content, understanding the essence and context.

- **Optimized Scheduling**: Ever wondered when the best time to post that groundbreaking blog is? Worry not. Our AI's got an inner clock that's aligned with the social media universe.

- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Whether you're a LinkedIn lover, an Instagram influencer, or a Twitter trendsetter, our app talks to all platforms fluently.

- **Bulk Scheduling**: Tired of micromanaging? Just throw your content into our scheduler and watch it spit out a well-organized content calendar. It's like meal prepping, but for your digital feeds.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get this party started, you'll need Python, Flask, and a couple of APIs. Not to mention a burning desire to make your life easier.

**Download the Repo and navigate within the folder**

**Go to the command line within the project and run the server and client app**
```
cd ContentApp && pnpm start
cd ContentMachine && . env/bin/activate && python src/app.py
```
Project will be running on `localhost:4200`

**Login with Goole**

**Link accounts**

**Automate all of your content**

But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Or at least that's what Spiderman said.
