A true symbol of technological progress which cannot be understated! By 1790, British inventors Thomas Newcomen and James Watt had succeeded in unlocking the source of power, driving industrial machinery and railway transport. The huge developments made afterwards, such as the production of engines that would generate cooling systems for the nascent drinks industry, or enhancing steel production with their circular millers ‚Äì had immediate global implications by propelling industrialization and boosting world trade. Let's remember these geniuses behind the steam engine for the lasting impact they have made - the changes made then still reverberate today! #History #IndustriaRevolition",
