The iconic American Pony Express was revolutionized by the introduction of the railway engine in the mid 19th century. This technology caused a dramatic shift in transportation, making the Pony Express outdated. For years, the Pony Express had allowed riders to carry letters over vast distances. Horseback riding was replaced by speedier and cost-efficient transport-- passengers could finally easily cover longer distances in shorter amounts of time. In addition to being more affordable, another benefit of the railroad was its 24/7 schedule, compared to the limited hours of horseback riding. Though enduring, the Pony Express was unable to keep up with the arrival of the indispensable trains.
