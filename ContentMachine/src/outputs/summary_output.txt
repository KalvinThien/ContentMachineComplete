It’s estimated that most of the world’s population relies on industrialized agriculture to produce enough food each year to meet global demand. If food production suddenly ended today, the world’s population would face mass starvation. This crisis would have devastating consequences.

Currently, food production averages 179-183 kg/capita/year. We would quickly hit the food carrying capacity of humans which is 990-392kg/capita/year. Major food shortages would happen as farmers and harvests ceased to exist. By Monday, with no food from industrial farms, grocery stores would likely be empty. Governments would struggle to feed people from less industrialized countries. Those who have enough saved up would be able to purchase essential items like water, bread, soft drinks, etc. from smaller, local stores. 

The long-term crisis of food shortages exacerbated by an inability to find safe alternatives means that globalstability, health, and well-being would face extreme risks,includingthe potential for economic collapse, mass starvation, and climate chaos. Furthermore,societies which rely on publicly-funded school food programs will face the brunt of this crisis, as many young learners in all regions of the world lack basic food needs.

If food production suddenly ceased today, it would lead to widespread poverty, famine, and chaos. The world's population would be plunged into a state of desperation, as food resources vanished and governments struggled to provide for those in the most need. An inability to find safe alternatives would result in the global economy collapsing, triggering even wider implications for mass starvation, economic strife and environmental destruction. With no food from industrial farming, supplies from grocery stores would quickly deplete, while those without reserves would rapidly become desperate. Loss of school meals would especially affect children, blocking essential nutrition and leading to lifelong consequences.
